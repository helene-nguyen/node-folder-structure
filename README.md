# Folder Structure for Node.js

## Introduction

Welcome here ! ðŸŽ¡

This is my version of a folder structure when I work on my Node.js project. 

Have you ever wondering how you can have a starter folder structure just to fill out and start your project fastly ? I did and here I am.

You'll find in this repository a way to create the whole folder structure with a script bash to enter in your console.

I hope that my instructions will be clear, contact me if not.

I'm open for all suggestions and improvement ! ðŸ˜ƒ

Thank you for reading and let's go !

## How to start ?

So, it's a folder structure for Node.js, but you don't need to know Node to doing this (even if I hope you know how to use it, that's the reason you're here now right ? haha) 

You'll find below the structure :

## What do I have to do ?

Firstable, clone the repository.

The script will init [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) dependencies, it will open [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) so if you don't have VSC, open "files-node.sh" and remove "code ." at the end of the file.

Open a console in the file (I personally use Git Bash)
